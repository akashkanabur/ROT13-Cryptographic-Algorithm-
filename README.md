## 🔐 About ROT13

ROT13 is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the alphabet. It's a special case of the Caesar cipher.

**Key Properties:**
- **Symmetrical**: Encryption and decryption use the same algorithm
- **Self-reciprocal**: Applying ROT13 twice returns the original text
- **Weak security**: Designed for obscurity, not real encryption
- **Preserves case**: Maintains uppercase/lowercase formatting
